<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Here we have a JavaScript React Project which is named as "React Task Tracker" built with ReactJS as front-end and JSON server as a Back-end.
<br />

## Technical Components
This is a TO-DO List app which is named as "React Task Tracker". JSON Server helps in a way to save and serve the Data for this app. We always forget things that misses many opportunities. Here i have a Task tracker project which helps us to track all our planned Tasks where we will finish them on time.

### React - Load the Tasks at real-time. Instead of refreshing the whole page, particular components/tasks will be altered.

### JSON Server - handles the background job to store and retrieve the Tasks with Date and Time.

## Build Version

No Login Required.
The app is not deployed yet but working fine locally and I am attaching the Captures of them.
